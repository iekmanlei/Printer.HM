# Printer.HM

Codes and CAD designs of the 3D printed part generated in the article 'A hackable, multi-functional, and modular extrusion 3D printer for soft materials' (Lei et al. _Scientific Reports_, 2022)

### Requirements 
- The code for the printing operation requires [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), Python (3.6+ and was tested with 3.7.6) and the following dependencies on Python: serial, [SwiftAPI](https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK).
- The code for the heating operation requires [Processing](https://processing.org/download) and [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). 

## Structure of the repository
### CAD Files
- Contain the CAD designs and the stl files of all the customised parts of the printer (i.e., frame, printhead heater, printhead, stage heater and stages)

### Codes 
- Contain the codes for the heating operation and the printing operation.
